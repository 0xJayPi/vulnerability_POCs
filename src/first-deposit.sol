Name: First deposit bug

Description:
First pool depositor can be front-run and have part of their deposit stolen
In this case, we can control the variable "_supplied." 
By depositing a small amount of loan tokens to obtain pool tokens, 
we can front-run other depositors' transactions and inflate the price of pool tokens through a substantial "donation."
Consequently, the attacker can withdraw a greater quantity of loan tokens than they initially possessed.

This calculation issue arises because, in Solidity, if the pool token value for a user becomes less than 1,
it is essentially rounded down to 0.

Mitigation:  
Consider minting a minimal amount of pool tokens during the first deposit 
and sending them to zero address, this increases the cost of the attack. 
Uniswap V2 solved this problem by sending the first 1000 LP tokens to the zero address. 
The same can be done in this case i.e. when totalSupply() == 0, 
send the first min liquidity LP tokens to the zero address to enable share dilution.
